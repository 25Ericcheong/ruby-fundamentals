# Ruby Fundamentals

Started this repository to take notes while I go through the Odin project for learning Ruby. Similar to my other fundamentals repository, the intention here is to learn the fundamentals and start building right after / during the process.

## Ruby Features

###  Documentation

- `::` can sometimes be used to define namespaces to group and differentiate classes of the same name from one to another. It can also mean that it is a class method which is worth noting.
- `::` is for class methods and `#` would relate to instance methods. 
-  Included modules would allow a module to utilize functionalities from another module. An example is `String` class being able to utilize methods from the `Comparable` module.

### RubyGems

- Allow us to use useful Ruby libraries on system so we can focus on implementation of features. `Gemfile` offers solution to organize gems and their dependencies in central location. 
- Use `pry` to debug. Will need to install with gems
